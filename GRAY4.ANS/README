This is Realease 4 of Gray, a parser generator written in Forth. It
takes grammars in an extended BNF syntax and generates recursive
descent parsers as executable Forth code.

PORTING AND TESTING

As far as I know, the current version is ANS Forth conformant, with
environmental dependences on case-insensitivity, stacks that are big
enough (in particular, it needs a lot of return stack, e.g. 360 cells
for oberon.fs), , and that 1 CHARS equals 1. It requires words from the
CORE EXT and TOOLS EXT wordsets. A standard system is still standard
after loading Gray. Gray has been tested with pfe-0.9.6 and an
unreleased ANS Forth implementation.

Some of the test programs require more wordsets; in particular,
mini.fs needs at least the FILE and SEARCH wordsets. Also, some test
programs define standard names in nonstandard ways, so a system is not
standard after loading them.

As distributed, Grays uses a space-hungry, but ANS conformant way of
remembering source code locations for later error messages (thanks to
Marcel Hendrix for that). Most systems will have words for accessing
the current source file name and line number. If you want to save
space, replace the stuff in gray.fs marked with `!!' with code for
accessing and printing your source location.

You can test Gray by loading test.fs. This needs more than 100KB on a
32-bit Forth with the present source location storage method (much
less if you reduce the amount space for storing source location
information). The output should look similar to test.out (test.out was
created with pfe).

AKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Marcel Hendrix for his ANS conformant error location code.
