This is a small contribution to F68KANS.  The file bios.a contains a bit of assembly code to provide the basicI/O functions that F68KANS needs to run under the OS-9/68000 OS.  Whenthe bios routines are linked with the program loader.c, F68KANS can beloaded and run under OS-9. I have implemented only the most basicparts, but it is enough to get going. The best way I found to run it is in a terminal emulator (i.e. sterm)via the pty (pseudo terminal) driver created by Reimer Mellin.  Thissolves some problems that I encountered between the terminal driverand the interpreter.  It also lets you dump the various files thatmake a complete FORTH (see the files in F68KANS/sysfth/) to theinterpreter easily.  The pty drivers, managers, etc. can be found onchestnut.cs.wisc.edu in /pub/OSK/DRIVERS/.One useful tidbit - to use F68KANS to work with absolute addresses youmust subtract the FORTH data segment address from them.  To get the FORTH data segment address from inside the interpreter, use the forth commandsforthparas 64 + @My thanks to Joerg for F68KANS.	Ed Gow
